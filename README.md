Diabetic Prediction Using Machine Learning ðŸ©ºðŸ“Š
Overview
This project predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical and lifestyle data using machine learning techniques. It aims to assist healthcare providers and individuals in early detection of diabetes for timely intervention.

Features
Input patient medical data such as glucose levels, BMI, age, etc.

Predict the likelihood of diabetes using a trained ML model.

Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance.

User-friendly interface for making predictions (if deployed as an app).

Dataset
The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, a widely-used dataset for diabetes prediction.

Dataset Features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours.

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).

SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).

Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).

BMI: Body Mass Index.

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (genetic risk).

Age: Patient's age.

Outcome: 0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic.

You can download the dataset from Kaggle.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Data Handling: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, xgboost

Model Deployment (optional): Flask/Django, Streamlit

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers.

Normalize and scale features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze feature distributions and correlations.

Model Training:

Train machine learning models such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Use cross-validation for better generalization.
